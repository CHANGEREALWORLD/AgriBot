## AgriBot 
**Smart Crop Recommendation System using Machine Learning**

AgriBot is a machine learning–based web application designed to assist farmers and agricultural decision-makers in selecting the most suitable crop based on soil and environmental conditions.  
The project focuses on improving crop yield and reducing agricultural risk through data-driven recommendations.

##  Project Objectives
- Assist farmers in crop selection  
- Reduce crop failure risks  
- Promote smart and sustainable agriculture  
- Demonstrate practical application of machine learning  

##Features

- Crop recommendation based on:
-  Machine Learning model trained on agricultural data
-  Simple and user-friendly web interface
-  Fast and accurate predictions
-  Practical real-world use case

##  How It Works

1. User enters soil and climate parameters  
2. Trained ML model processes the input  
3. System predicts the most suitable crop  
4. Result is displayed on the web interface  

## Machine Learning
- Python
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas
- NumPy

### Web Development
- React.js
- Flask (Backend API)
 
##  Dataset Information
The data was preprocessed and used to train a supervised machine learning model for accurate crop prediction.
